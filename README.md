## Introduction

D-RISE (Diverse Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation) is a black-box explanation method for object detectors. This algorithm generates saliency maps that highlight the most influential regions of an image that affect the model's predictions. This implementation is aimed at providing a tool for researchers and practitioners to understand and interpret the predictions of deep learning models.

## Features

- Generate saliency maps for any object detection model.
- Support for multiple image input formats.
- Customizable parameters for sampling and perturbation.
- Visualization tools for saliency maps.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `opencv-python`, `torch`, `matplotlib`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/d-rise-algorithm.git
    cd d-rise-algorithm
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Preparing the Model

Ensure you have a pre-trained object detection model. This can be any model that can take an image input and return predictions (e.g., bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores).

### Generating Saliency Maps

1. Import the necessary modules and load your model:
    ```python
    import torch
    from drise import DRise
    from your_model import load_model  # Custom function to load your model

    model = load_model()
    ```

2. Initialize the D-RISE algorithm with your model:
    ```python
    drise = DRise(model)
    ```

3. Generate a saliency map for an input image:
    ```python
    import cv2
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    saliency_map = drise.generate_saliency_map(image)

    plt.imshow(saliency_map, cmap='hot')
    plt.show()
    ```

### Customization

You can customize the parameters of the D-RISE algorithm, such as the number of samples, mask size, and the type of perturbation. Refer to the documentation within the `drise.py` file for more details.

## Examples

In the `examples` directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the D-RISE algorithm with different object detection models and image datasets.
